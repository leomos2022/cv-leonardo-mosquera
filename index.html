                        I’m Leonardo Mosquera, a passionate Web Developer and English Teacher with a love for creating engaging digital experiences and helping others improve their language skills. With a background in both technology and education, I combine my expertise to build intuitive websites and applications while also teaching English in a way that’s both fun and effective.

                        I started my journey in web development a few years ago, mastering various programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. My goal is to craft responsive, user-friendly sites that make a real impact. On the other hand, as an English teacher, I enjoy helping students overcome language barriers and achieve their communication goals, whether it’s through conversation practice or mastering grammar. <br>
                        <br>
                        When I’m not coding or teaching, you’ll find me exploring new technologies or finding creative ways to make learning English more interactive. I believe in continuous learning, and I’m always excited to take on new challenges!
